## Lyrics

I'm alone because I love you 
I love you with all of my heart
I'm alone because I have to be true
I'm sorry I can't say the same thing about you

Yesterday's kisses are bringin me pain
Yesterday's sunshine has turned into rain

I'm alone because I love you
I love you with all of my heart
