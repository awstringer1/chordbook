## Lyrics

Some of these days, you'll miss me honey
Some of these days, you're gonna feel so lonely
You're gonna miss my huggin', you're gonna miss my kissin'
You're gonna miss me honey when I'm far away

I feel so lonely, just for you only
You know honey, I've let you have your way
And when you leave me, I know it will grieve me
You'll miss your blue eyed baby some of these days
