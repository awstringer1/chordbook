## Lyrics

Oh, dear, how I need one sweet letter from you
How I'd love to read one sweet letter from you
You know that I'm praying the night and day through
Just hoping I'll get one sweet letter from you
Though it's not fair, and you don't care for me dearly
Drop me a line if you just sign Yours sincerely
You know that I'm praying the night and day through
Just hoping I'll get one sweet letter from you
