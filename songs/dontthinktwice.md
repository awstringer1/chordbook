## Lyrics

It ain't no use to sit and wonder why, babe
It don't matter anyhow
It ain't no use to sit and wonder why, babe
If you don't know by now
When your rooster crows at the break of dawn
Look out your window and I'll be gone
You're the reason I'm traveling on
Don't think twice, it's all right

And it ain't no use in turning on your light, babe
That light I never knowed
And it ain't no use in turning on your light, babe
I'm on the dark side of the road
But I wish there was somethin' you would do or say
To try and make me change my mind and stay
We never did too much talking anyway
Don't think twice, it's all right

It ain't no use in calling out my name, gal
Like you never done before
And it ain't no use in calling out my name, gal
I can't hear you anymore
I'm thinking and wondering walking down the road
I once loved a woman, a child, I'm told
I give her my heart but she wanted my soul
Don't think twice, it's all right

I'm walking down that long and lonesome road babe
Where I'm bound, I can't tell
Goodbye's too good a word, babe
So I'll just say, "Fare thee well"
I ain't saying you treated me unkind
You could've done better but I don't mind
You just kinda wasted my precious time
Don't think twice, it's all right
