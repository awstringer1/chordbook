## Lyrics

Rock my soul, with the Milneburg joys
Rock my soul, with the Milneburg joys
Play 'em mama, don't refuse
Separate me from the weary blues
Hey, hey, hey, hey
Sweet girl, syncopate your mama
All night long, with that Dixieland strain
Play it down, then do it again
Ev'ry time I hear that tune
Good luck says I'll be with you soon
That's just whyy I've got the Milneburg joys
