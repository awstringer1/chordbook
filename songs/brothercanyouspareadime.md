## Lyrics

(Intro)
They used to tell me I was building a dream
So I followed the mob
When it was earth to plow or guns to bear
I was always there on the job
They used to tell me I was building a life
With peace and glory ahead
So tell me why am I standing in line just waiting for bread?

(Chorus)
Once I built a railroad, made it run made it race against time
Once I built a rairoad, now it's done brother can you spare a dime?
Once I built a tower to the sun brick and rivet and lime
Once I built a tower, now it's done brother can you spare a dime?
Once in khaki suits gee, we looked swell
Full of that yankee Doodle De Dum
Half a million boots went slogging through hell
I was the kid with the drum
Say don't you remember, they called me Al it was Al all the time
Say don't you remember, I'm your pal brother can you spare a dime?
