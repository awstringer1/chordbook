## Lyrics

Somebody else is taking my place
Somebody else shares your sweet embrace
And while I am trying so hard to keep from crying
You walk around with a smile upon your face

What's the use of vows that we made
What's the use of plans that were laid

My poor heart is breaking
My poor soul is acheing
Somebody else is taking my place
