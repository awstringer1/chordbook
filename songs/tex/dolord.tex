I've got a home in gloryland that outshines the sun \\ 
I've got a home in gloryland that outshines the sun \\ 
I've got a home in gloryland that outshines the sun \\ 
Way beyond the blue \\ 

Do lord, oh do lord, oh do remember me \\ 
Do lord, oh do lord, oh do remember me \\ 
Do lord, oh do lord, oh do remember me \\ 
Way beyond the blue \\ 

The gospel train is coming, you better get your business right \\ 
The gospel train is coming, you better get your business right \\ 
The gospel train is coming, you better get your business right \\ 
That train might come for you tonight \\
