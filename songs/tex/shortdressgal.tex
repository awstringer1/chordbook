\subsection*{Lyrics}


I knew a little girl, her name was Bea \\ 
She flirt with every man she ever did see \\ 
She flirt with a man named Mr. Key \\ 
Had a dress made that's to her knees \\ 

She went to the river, couldn't get across \\ 
Paid five dollars for an old drab horse \\ 
The horse wouldn't pull, she swapped him for a bull \\ 
All you could here was guys say \\ 

Look here (everybody looking) \\ 
Look here (everybody see) \\ 
Look here (everybody looking) \\ 
Short dress, home-made style \\
