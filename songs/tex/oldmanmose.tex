\subsection*{Lyrics}


There once was an old man with a very crooked nose \\ 
He lived in a log hut, they called him Old Man Mose \\ 
Early one morning I knocked upon his door \\ 
I didn't hear a single song, I won't do that no more \\ 

I went around the side, and I peaked into a crack \\ 
There I saw that old man laying flat on his back \\ 
Whether old man was dead or sleeping I surely did not know \\ 
But after looking through that crack I won't do that no more \\ 

I believe (old man) \\ 
I believe (old man) \\ 
I believe (old man) \\ 
That Old Man Mose is dead \\ 
I believe (old man) \\ 
I believe (old man) \\ 
I believe (old man) \\ 
That Old Man Mose is dead \\ 

(He believes) Mose kicked the bucket \\ 
(He believes) Mose kicked the bucket \\ 
(He believes) Mose kicked the bucket \\ 
(He believes he's dead) \\ 
(He believes) Mose kicked the bucket \\ 
(He believes) Mose kicked the bucket \\ 
(He believes) Mose kicked the bucket \\ 
(He believes he's dead) \\
