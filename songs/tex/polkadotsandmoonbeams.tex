\subsection*{Lyrics}


A country dance was being held in a garden \\ 
I felt a bump and heard an, "Oh, beg your pardon" \\ 
Suddenly, I saw polka dots and moonbeams \\ 
All around a pug-nosed dream \\ 
The music started, and was I the perplexed one? \\ 
I held my breath and said, "May I have the next one?" \\ 
In my frightened arms, polka dots and moonbeams \\ 
Sparkled on a pug-nosed dream \\ 
There were questions in the eyes of other dancers \\ 
As we floated over the floor \\ 
There were questions \\ 
But my heart knew all the answers \\ 
And perhaps a few things more \\ 
Now, in a cottage built of lilacs and laughter \\ 
I know the meaning of the words "ever after" \\ 
And I'll always see polka dots and moonbeams \\ 
When I kiss the pug-nosed dream \\
