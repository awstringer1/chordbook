\subsection*{Lyrics}


I'm confessing that I love you \\ 
Tell me do you love me too \\ 
I'm confessing that I need you \\ 
Honest I do \\ 

In your eyes I read such strange things \\ 
But your lips deny they're true \\ 
Would you answer really change things \\ 
Making me blue \\ 

I am so afraid you'll leave me \\ 
Saying can we still be friends \\ 
If you go darling it will grieve me \\ 
All of life on you depends \\ 

I'm confessing that I love you \\ 
Dreaming dreams of you in vain \\ 
I'm confessing that I love you \\ 
Over again \\ 

I'm just a gigolo, everywhere I go \\ 
People know the part that I play \\ 
Paid for every dance, selling each romance \\ 
All my life dear I've played \\ 
There will come a day when youth will pass away \\ 
What will they say about me \\ 
When the end comes I will know  \\ 
I was just a gigolo \\ 
And life goes on without me \\
