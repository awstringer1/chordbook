\subsection*{Lyrics}


I'm free as a wandering breeze \\ 
I'm free to wander any place I please \\ 
And yet, I can't escape from you \\ 

I'm free as the birds in the trees \\ 
I'm even free to sail the seven seas \\ 
And yet, I can't escape from you \\ 

I could ride away and hide away \\ 
Where we were miles apart \\ 
But when I got there, I'd find you there \\ 
Right in my heart \\ 

So you see that I'm really not free \\ 
I'm so afraid you might escape from me \\ 
And yet, I can't escape from you \\
