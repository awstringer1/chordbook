I had someone else before I had you \\ 
And I'll have someone after you're gone \\ 
Sweethearts and street cars don't worry me \\ 
There'll soon be another one along \\ 

No need to stay go any day \\ 
I've got a swingin' door right in my heart \\ 
And it swings either way \\ 

I had someone else before I had you \\ 
And I'll have someone after you're gone \\ 

(Alternate bridge) \\ 
If you don't like your bunk pack all your junk \\ 
Won't take you long because you're standing in the middle of your trunk \\
