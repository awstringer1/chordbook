Oh, dear, how I need one sweet letter from you \\ 
How I'd love to read one sweet letter from you \\ 
You know that I'm praying the night and day through \\ 
Just hoping I'll get one sweet letter from you \\ 
Though it's not fair, and you don't care for me dearly \\ 
Drop me a line if you just sign Yours sincerely \\ 
You know that I'm praying the night and day through \\ 
Just hoping I'll get one sweet letter from you \\
