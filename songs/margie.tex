\subsection*{Lyrics}


Margie, I'm always thinking of you \\ 
Margie, I'll tell the world about you \\ 
Don't forget the promise you made \\ 
You know I bought a home and ring and everything \\ 
Margie, you are my inspiration \\ 
Days are never blue \\ 
After all is said and done, there is only one \\ 
Darling, Margie, it's you \\
