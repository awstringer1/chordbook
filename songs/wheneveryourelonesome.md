## Lyrics

Whenever you're lonesome, just telephone me
When you're all by your own-some, and you want company
Blues overtakes you, I'll never foresake you
I'll always be at the end of the line, waiting for you

Though distance divides us, from Frisco to Maine
I'd walk a million miles just to see your smile again
Your kisses and laugher are worth running after
Whenever you're lonesome, just telephone me
