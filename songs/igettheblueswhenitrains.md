## Lyrics

I get the blues when it rains
The blues I can't lose when it rains
Each little drop that falls on my window pane
Always reminds me of the tears I've shed in vain

I sit and wait for the sun
To shine down on me once again
It rained when I found you
It rained when I lost you
That's why I'm so blue when it rains
